## What It Does

The proposed project is a voice based authentication system. Our system will be able to differentiate between machine voice assistants as well recognize the voice if registered. Final product should be such that no pre-recorded voice or voice assistant should be able to pass the authentication system. It can be scaled and utilized in different industries like banks, shops etc where there is a need to verify and authenticate the entity before giving them access to any resources.
